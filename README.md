### How I Made Learning Engaging

Starting to learn something at the very beginning can be uncomfortable to some, or it can be challenging with the lack of motivation. Therefore, I wanted to incorprate a more fun aspect to the web app to keep users engaged.

**Dart Game**
In between each challenge, users are faced with a very small and quick yet still simulating game. A random target appears on the screen and users have limited time to click with accuracy. To gamify the process of learning, the accuracy of the latest click and average "shots" are kept track of on the scoreboard.

### Relevance
Created as a sample project for the **SQL Valley** position at TU/e. This demonstrates:
- Input validation and feedback logic (Educational Programmer)
- Event-driven UI and interactive node flow (Skill Tree Tool Developer)
